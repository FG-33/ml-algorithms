    "# Logistic Regression\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression introduces the new concept of classification. In comparison, linear regression etc. are used to calculate, based on miscellaneous input values, a real number that is directly applicable in the real world. E.g., using linear regression to determine the relationship between the age, in years, of a person and the length, in hours, of time they spend on the internet each day. The result is a real number which corresponds to a quantity of hours. In the beginning of the classification procedure a fixed set of classes is defined. In the most simplistic scenario there are two labels. In general one of the two labels is associated with the presence of a certain \"something\" while the other one is associated with it's absence. In medicine, for example, the judgement whether the detected tumour inside a person's brain is malignant or non-malignant can be viewed as a classification problem. The \"something\" in this scenario would be the tumour being malignant or non-malignent. The classes are encoded as natural numbers starting at zero. To accomplish this the previously used model will be enhanced using the sigmoid function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "sig(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}\n",
    "\\tag{1}\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The following image displays a plot of the sigmoid function. The corresponding limits are below the image:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](graphics/sigmoid_function.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} sig(z) = 0 &&&& \\text{and} && \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} sig(z) = 1 \n",
    "\\tag{2}\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the input $z$ the result is will always be between $0$ and $1$. In logistic regression $z$ will be substituted with the previously used model. The result is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "h(x, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x^T\\theta}}\n",
    "\\tag{3}\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally a threshold $\\tau$ will be applied. Is a value smaller then the threshold it is set to $0$, is it bigger it will be set to $1$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "     y = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll} 1, & h(x, \\theta) \\ge \\tau \\\\\n",
    "         0, & h(x, \\theta) < \\tau\\end{array}\\right. .\n",
    "\\tag{4}\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If an input $x$ results in an output $y$ then $x$ is classified as $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the model was modified the previously used cost function is not applicable anymore. A new one must be formulated. Therefore the partial derivatives might change so the gradient descent equation for updating $\\theta$ has to be adjusted as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cost Function\n",
    "\n",
    "To start with it will be shown why the previously used cost function cannot be used anymore. Here is the cost function again:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "J(x, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{2m} \\sum_{k=1}^m[h_{lin}(x^{(k)}, \\theta) - y^{(k)}]^2\n",
    "\\tag{5}\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the addition of the non-linear sigmoid function the cost function as seen in (5) can be non-convex. Here is an examplary plot for $x = [1, 3, 6, 1, 40, 10]^T$ and $y = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]^T$ that shows the possibility of non-convexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](graphics/lin_reg_cost_in_log_reg_non-convex.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If gradient descent is used to minimize a non-convex function, convergence to the global minimum cannot be guaranteed. Therefore the resulting $\\theta$ might not be the optimal solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "The new cost function incorporates that the ground truth labels can only be either $0$ or $1$ while the estimated values are in the interval $[0,1]$. It follows the intuition that the cost should maximize/be high if the estimated value is $1$ while the ground truth is $0$ and vise versa. The first approach is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "     Cost(h(x, \\theta), y) = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll} -log(h(x, \\theta)), & y = 0 \\\\\n",
    "         -log(1-h(x, \\theta)), & y = 1 \\end{array}\\right. .\n",
    "\\tag{6}\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of $y = 1$ the cost $Cost(h(x, \\theta), y) \\to \\infty$ if the estimated value $h(x, \\theta) \\to 1$.\n",
    "In the other case of $y = 0$ the cost $Cost(h(x, \\theta), y) \\to \\infty$ if the estimated value $h(x, \\theta) \\to 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the case notation of the cost function is inconvenient for implementation the function will be simplified:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "J(x, \\theta) = -\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{k=1}^m y^{(k)} log \\; h(x^{(k)}, \\theta) + (1 - y^{(k)})\\; log(1 - h(x^{(k)}, \\theta))\n",
    "\\tag{5}\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The case differentiation is realized by multiplying the inappropriate case with $0$. This can be done by multiplying the case for $y = 1$ with $y$ and the case for $y = 0$ with ($1 - y$). This cost function is guaranteed to be convex. Therefore the resulting $\\theta$ will be the optimal solution for the given training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce the likelihood of overfitting, regularization is added to the cost function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "J(x, \\theta) = -\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{k=1}^m y^{(k)} log \\; h(x^{(k)}, \\theta) + (1 - y^{(k)})\\; log(1 - h(x^{(k)}, \\theta)) + \\frac{\\lambda}{2m} \\sum_{j=1}^n \\theta_j^2\n",
    "\\tag{6}\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The added term functions as a second minimization goal. On top of the difference between the estimated value and the ground truth, the overall size of the $\\theta_j$ is relevant as well. This reduces the complexity of the resulting model. Less complex models are less prone to overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily the partial derivatives for the new cost function are identical to the ones in (4) and (5) from [linear regression](linear_regression_one_variable.ipynb). The equation for updating $\\theta$ will be reused:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "\\theta^{t+1} = \\theta^t - \\frac{\\alpha}{m} X^T (h(X, \\theta) - \\vec{y}) \n",
    "\\tag{7}\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The regularization term is still missing. The sum rule can be applied which results in: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "\\theta^{t+1} = \\theta^t - \\alpha [ \\frac{1}{m} X^T (h(X, \\theta) - \\vec{y}) + \\frac{\\lambda}{m}\\theta]\n",
    "\\tag{7}\n",
